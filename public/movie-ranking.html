<h1>London's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Three Favorite Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Stardust</h3> <img src="../assets/images/stardust.gif" alt="Claire Danes passive aggressive judging her capture">
<p>Has Magic, Romance, Strong LGBT character, and Action</p>
<h3>Sex, Lies, & Politics</h3><img src="../assets/images/sex-politics-cocktails.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Quirky Gay Comedy that is deliciously ridiculous</p>
<h3>Memoirs of a Geisha</h3><img src="../assets/images/memoirs.gif" alt="">
<p>Just a beautifully tragic story about a girl who made the most of terrible circumstances</p>
